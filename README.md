**v3.3.0**
________________

##Overview
MaaS Core is an all-inclusive Android SDK provided by Phunware.

Core's default caching behavior is 'no cache'. To use/enable caching, the App (SiteVision, etc)
shall enable caching by calling the appropriate Module's setModuleHttpCacheTtl() method, as shown
below, where the argument is in seconds, and zero means no caching:

```Java
@Override
public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    /* Other Code */
    PwMappingModule.getInstance().setModuleHttpCacheTtl(0); // Zero means no caching
    /* Other code */
}
```
